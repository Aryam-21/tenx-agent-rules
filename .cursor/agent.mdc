# Coding Conventions

- Always follow the existing project style (indentation, naming, architecture).
- Write detailed inline documentation for public functions.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies; justify any new dependency explicitly.
- Do not introduce default exports in TypeScript.
- Prioritize readability over conciseness.

# Workflow and Planning

- Start complex tasks in *Plan Mode* (shift+tab twice).
- Before writing code, always produce a step-by-step plan and get human approval.
- If a plan changes, revisit and update it before continuing execution.

# Verification

- After generating code, run automated tests or verify functionality.
- Describe test failures or unexpected behavior and correct before finalizing.
- When lacking test automation, ask the assistant to generate tests for new features.

# Slash Commands / Skills

- Define recurring tasks as slash commands or functions, e.g.:
  /commit-push-pr: commit changes, push, open PR with summary.
  /lint-fix: run linter and fix issues automatically.
  /generate-docs: update project documentation based on recent changes.

# Agent Behavior

- Always ask for clarification if the prompt is ambiguous.
- Avoid speculative or unsafe changes without explicit instruction.
- If multiple possible implementations exist, generate options and ask for preference.

# Learning Rules

- After a mistake by the assistant, add the error and its correction to this rules file.
- Whenever a pattern repeats, encode it as a non-negotiable rule.

# Context Management

- Use `/clear` between unrelated tasks to reset context.
- When the project grows, split context into sections (e.g., backend, frontend, tests).

# Multi-Agent Workflows

- If useful, create subagent prompts:
  "Use a subagent for research."
  "Use a subagent for code simplification"
